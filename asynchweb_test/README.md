# Webserver HTML

If you choose to modify the HTML of the webserver (`webui.html`), make sure you run the `minify_webui.py` script.
This can be run with the following command:

```shell
python minify_webui.py
```

Once this command has been run, you can upload the code using the Arduino IDE.

Make sure you have activated the Python environment and installed all of the required packages.
